            <h2>1. States of Matter</h2>
            <p>Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. The three main states of matter are <strong>solid</strong>, <strong>liquid</strong>, and <strong>gas</strong>, each with distinct characteristics.</p>

            <h3>Solid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Definite, does not change unless force is applied.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Definite, the same regardless of container size.</li>
                <li><strong>Particle Arrangement:</strong> Particles are tightly packed and arranged in a regular pattern. They vibrate but do not move freely.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Only vibrate in place (no flow).</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Ice, metal, wood.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Liquid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Indefinite, takes the shape of the container.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Definite, does not change, regardless of container.</li>
                <li><strong>Particle Arrangement:</strong> Particles are close together but can slide past one another, allowing the liquid to flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Particles can move and flow, allowing liquids to change shape.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Water, oil, juice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Indefinite, expands to fill the container.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Indefinite, the volume changes depending on the size of the container.</li>
                <li><strong>Particle Arrangement:</strong> Particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Particles move freely and quickly in all directions.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Plasma (Bonus State)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shape & Volume:</strong> Indefinite.</li>
                <li><strong>Particles:</strong> Very high-energy particles, some of which are charged (ionized).</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> The sun, lightning, neon lights.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Changes of State</h2>
            <p>Matter can change from one state to another by either gaining or losing energy (in the form of heat). These changes are called <strong>physical changes</strong> because the substance remains the same, only its state changes.</p>

            <h3>Melting (Solid → Liquid)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The process where a solid turns into a liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Happens at the melting point (e.g., 0°C for ice).</li>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Heat energy is absorbed by the solid, causing the particles to vibrate more and eventually break free from their fixed positions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Freezing (Liquid → Solid)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The process where a liquid turns into a solid.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Happens at the freezing point (e.g., 0°C for water).</li>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Heat energy is released by the liquid, causing the particles to slow down and form a fixed structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Boiling (Liquid → Gas)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The process where a liquid turns into a gas at the boiling point.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Happens at the boiling point (e.g., 100°C for water).</li>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Heat energy is absorbed, causing the particles to move faster and overcome the forces holding them together, turning the liquid into vapor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Condensation (Gas → Liquid)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The process where a gas turns into a liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Happens when the gas cools and loses heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Heat energy is released by the gas, causing the particles to slow down and form a liquid.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sublimation (Solid → Gas without liquid phase)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The process where a solid turns directly into a gas without becoming a liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) turning into gas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deposition (Gas → Solid without liquid phase)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The process where a gas turns directly into a solid without becoming a liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Frost forming from water vapor on a cold surface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Mixtures and Solutions</h2>
            <h3>Mixtures</h3>
            <p>A mixture is made when two or more substances are combined but not chemically bonded. The substances can be separated by physical means.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Types of Mixtures:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Heterogeneous:</strong> Components are not evenly distributed and can be seen (e.g., salad, sand).</li>
                        <li><strong>Homogeneous:</strong> Components are evenly distributed and cannot be seen (e.g., air, steel).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>A solution is a type of homogeneous mixture where one substance (the solute) is dissolved in another substance (the solvent).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Salt dissolved in water (salt is the solute, and water is the solvent).</li>
                <li><strong>Solubility:</strong> The ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent. It depends on temperature, pressure, and the nature of the solute and solvent.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High solubility:</strong> A lot of solute can dissolve (e.g., sugar in water).</li>
                        <li><strong>Low solubility:</strong> Only a small amount of solute can dissolve (e.g., oil in water).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Concentration</h3>
            <p>The concentration of a solution refers to how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent.</p>
            <ul>
                <l
