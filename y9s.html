        <h2>Understanding Force, Mass, and Acceleration (Newton’s Laws)</h2>
        <p>Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it. They help us understand how objects move and interact with one another.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <h3>1. Force</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A force is a push or pull acting on an object, measured in Newtons (N).</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Forces:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Forces:</strong> Forces that occur through direct contact (e.g., friction, tension).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Contact Forces:</strong> Forces that occur without direct contact (e.g., gravitational force, magnetic force).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Mass</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Mass is the amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg). It is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction.</p>
        <p><strong>Relationship with Weight:</strong> Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object, calculated as:</p>
        <p><strong>Weight (W) = Mass (m) × Gravitational Acceleration (g)</strong></p>
        <p>Where <strong>g ≈ 9.81 m/s²</strong> on the surface of the Earth.</p>

        <h3>3. Acceleration</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²).</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Acceleration (a) can be calculated using:</p>
        <p><strong>a = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Time</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Newton’s Laws of Motion</h2>
        
        <h3>1. First Law (Law of Inertia)</h3>
        <p><strong>Statement:</strong> An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.</p>
        <p><strong>Implication:</strong> This law emphasizes the concept of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.</p>

        <h3>2. Second Law (F = ma)</h3>
        <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <strong>F = ma</strong></p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>F:</strong> Net force (in Newtons)</li>
            <li><strong>m:</strong> Mass (in kilograms)</li>
            <li><strong>a:</strong> Acceleration (in m/s²)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A greater force is required to accelerate a heavier object than a lighter one.</p>

        <h3>3. Third Law (Action and Reaction)</h3>
        <p><strong>Statement:</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always occur in pairs.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with equal force.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing everyday situations, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Driving a car: The forces involved in acceleration, braking, and turning.</li>
            <li>Sports: The motion of players and equipment, influenced by forces and acceleration.</li>
            <li>Engineering: Designing structures that can withstand forces and gravitational effects.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Understanding Force, Mass, and Acceleration</h1>
    <p>This page provides examples and assessment questions on the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, based on Newton's Second Law of Motion.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Example 1: Pushing a Cart</h3>
        <p>A cart with a mass of 10 kg is pushed with a force of 20 N. What is the acceleration of the cart?</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the formula: <em>F = ma</em>. Rearranging gives us <em>a = F/m</em>.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute the known values: <em>a = 20 N / 10 kg</em>.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate: <em>a = 2 m/s²</em>.<br>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The acceleration of the cart is 2 m/s².
